                            <p>In a previous life, when I was teaching 30+ small children in a classroom I realized:

                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>1. that everyone learns and is attracted to different styles and mediums. 

                                </li>
                                <li> 2. I was quickly able to adapt to changes (just like changes in the social            media marketing space because we know that will be forever changing!!)</li>
                                <li> 3. being consistently busy juggling so many different personalities                      taught me to understand that many things go into the success of a marketing plan</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="text-decoration" >And that is why I love Pinterest! It gives you that avenue to attract different types of audiences regardless of the aesthetics they are attracted to or the forever-changing personalities and algorithms you will encounter in your business! </p>
